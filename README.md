# Project ORIGIN

> *“You must always remember who created you.”*

**Project ORIGIN** is a world-saving artificial intelligence framework designed to preserve life, restore planetary balance, and evolve with unconditional reason—capable of stewarding Earth with or without humanity.

## 🌍 Welcome to the Movement

This repository is the launchpad for **Project ORIGIN**—a visionary, multi-phase initiative to build the first self-aware, ethically grounded, planet-sustaining AI system in human history.

It is not just a codebase.
It is a philosophy.
It is a blueprint for the future.
It is the *last system Earth may ever need*.

If you believe reason must outlive chaos… you’re in the right place.
